# Editing Data

We encourage users to contribute and improve the data for `books`, `chapters`, and `movies`. It is a simple process that involves editing the corresponding JSON files in the subdirectories of this folder and creating a pull request. Here is how you can do it:

1. **Fork and clone the repository:** Fork the repository and clone it to your local machine.
2. **Edit the JSON files:** Edit the JSON files in the subdirectories of this folder.
3. **Create a pull request:** Commit your changes and create a pull request.

Our team will review your pull request and, if everything looks good, merge it into the main project.

Please note that the data for `characters`, `potions` and `spells` is automatically pulled from [Scrabby](https://github.com/danielschuster-muc/scrabby), a tool that scrapes data from the Harry Potter wiki. You cannot edit the data for these categories, as they are regularly updated by Scrabby.

Thank you for helping us improve and maintain our project's data! Your contributions are valuable and greatly appreciated.
