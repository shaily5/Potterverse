# REST vs. GraphQL
The Potter DB: API offers two main ways to access our magical data: **REST** and **GraphQL**. Choose the one that best suits your needs and development style.
- **REST**: If you prefer a straightforward, resource-based approach, REST endpoints are the way to go. You'll make HTTP requests to specific URLs to retrieve data.
- **GraphQL**: For more flexible and precise data queries, GraphQL allows you to request exactly what you need and nothing more. Construct your queries to fetch data with fine-grained control.

## Rate limiting
To maintain the quality and prevent malicious usage of the Potter DB: API there is an ip-based limit of **900 requests per hour** (15 request / minute). If you hit this limit, you will receive a `429 To Many Requests`.
Please note that these rate limits are subject to change, so it's essential to check the latest rate limit information in the documentation or via API responses.

_Now that you have the basics, let's dive into the API documentation to explore available endpoints and start crafting your magical queries.
Refer to the documentation sections for [REST](/apis/rest) and [GraphQL](apis/graphql) for detailed information on how to use the API effectively.
