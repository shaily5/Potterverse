# GraphQL API
Our GraphQL API provides a flexible and powerful way to interact with the Potter DB. This section will introduce you to the key aspects of our GraphQL API and how to leverage its capabilities.

## GraphQL Endpoint
To make GraphQL queries and mutations, send `POST` requests to the GraphQL endpoint (`/graphql`) with your queries and variables in the request body. The API expects the request body to be in JSON format.

## Querying Data
GraphQL allows you to request precisely the data you need. To construct a query, specify the fields you want to retrieve and their relationships. For example:

```graphql
{
  books(first: 3) {
    totalCount
    pageInfo {
      hasNextPage
    }
    edges {
      node {
        title
        releaseDate
        chapters {
          edges {
            node {
              title
              slug
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  character(slug: "harry-potter") {
    name
  }
}
```
In this query, we are requesting the `title` and `releaseDate` of the first three books, as well as the `title` and `slug` of all chapters of each book. Additionally, we are requesting the `name` of the character with the slug `harry-potter`.

## Schema
To get an overview of the schema of the GraphQL API have a look at our [GraphQL Schema](https://github.com/danielschuster-muc/potter-db/blob/master/backend/app/graphql/schema.json).
